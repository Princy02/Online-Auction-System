# Auction Prediction Project 📊



Predicting auction dynamics, one bid at a time! This project aims to bridge the gap in auction analytics by forecasting bid-by-bid trajectories leading to the final sale price.

## Introduction 🚀

Auctions represent a dynamic marketplace, with participants engaging in real-time bidding wars to secure desired items. Traditionally, the emphasis in auction-related analytics has been on predicting the final sale price. This project focuses on forecasting the granular bid-by-bid trajectory leading to that final price.

By leveraging online auction data, we introduce a predictive algorithm that not only anticipates the final auction price but also provides insights into the anticipated progression of bids leading to that culmination.

## Getting Started 🛠️

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required Python libraries.
3. Use the provided Jupyter Notebook to explore the code and run the models.
4. Enjoy the journey into the world of auction dynamics!

## Data Analysis 📈

In this section, we analyze the dataset, handle missing data, and perform data preprocessing tasks. The goal is to prepare the data for modeling and visualization.

### Key Tasks:

- Data loading and initial exploration.
- Handling missing data.
- Detecting and addressing outliers.
- Data visualization using seaborn and matplotlib.

## Modeling 🤖

Here, we dwelve into the heart of the project: building machine learning models to predict various auction features, including closing prices, the number of bids per auction, bidder rates, and bid times.

### Key Models:

- Linear Regression
- XGBoost Regressor

## Feature Engineering 🧰

The success of predictive modeling often depends on feature engineering. We create additional features to enhance the quality of input data, including bid rank within auctions and previous bid values.

### Feature Engineering Techniques:

- Rank calculation
- Temporal feature creation
- Data transformations

## Results 📊

This section presents the results of the predictive models, including RMSE scores and visualizations. We assess the performance of each model and discuss the findings.
